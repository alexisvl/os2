This is my attempt at building an analog oscilloscope.

Bit of a self-indulgent project and I'm just posting it here so I don't hoard
it for myself. Nothing here is probably of use to anybody, and I have no plan
on making it in any way reproducible. License is CC BY-NC-SA, note
_non-commercial_.

## Specs

- At least 20 MHz bandwidth, maybe more
- Two to four channels
    - 1mV/div to 5V/div
    - AC, DC, GND coupling; 50 ohm or 1M termination
    - Switchable bandwidth limit per channel
- On-screen display for scale factors (raster scan)
- No software - ROM LUTs at most
