# Module board design

The module board format is inspired by (but not directly compatible with)
Eurocard. Overall dimensions are 160 by 100 mm, with a 64-pin DIN 41612
connector at the rear end, and a faceplate at the front end for connectors
and printed legends. The PCB layout file accompanying this document shall
serve as the specification for the format.
